# Contributing to @numra/vue

Patches are welcome. What this package renders is what a merchant's staff act
on, so the bar for a change is a test that would have caught the bug, not a
convincing description of it.

## Running the tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Node 22.12 or newer, as `engines` declares. The suite is the built-in
`node:test` runner and stubs `fetch`, so nothing reaches a network and no key
is needed.

## Every change needs a test

Every package in this family ships a regression suite, and it is the only
thing standing between a refactor and a silent behavioural change. So:

- A bug fix comes with a test that fails before it and passes after.
- A new option or export comes with a test that exercises it.
- A change to existing behaviour comes with the changed assertion, and the
  reason for the change in the commit message.

`test/no-credentials.test.js` is not negotiable: it fails the build if an
`apiKey` or a reference to the Numra API appears in the source. That test *is*
the credential boundary — this package must only ever call the merchant's own
backend.

It is also the test that found the late-answer bug in the React hook, which is
worth remembering when a shared assertion looks like someone else's problem.

## Which repository your fix belongs in

These repositories are split out of a single monorepo. What you see here is
one package of twelve, and this one is a binding: debounce, abort, the
late-answer rule, risk states and badge styling all live in
[numra-browser](https://github.com/NumraApp/numra-browser), shared with the
React, Svelte and Angular packages.

So:

- Anything about *what a check means* — labels, colours, when a request fires,
  which answer wins — belongs in **`@numra/browser`**. Fixing it here alone is
  how the four bindings drift, and they have before.
- Anything Vue-shaped — reactivity, the composable's argument handling, the
  render function, prop names — belongs here.
- A change to what the endpoint returns belongs in
  [numra-js-core](https://github.com/NumraApp/numra-js-core), or in
  [numra-nuxt](https://github.com/NumraApp/numra-nuxt) if it is about the Nuxt
  server route.

If your fix lands in `@numra/browser`, this package picks it up as a
dependency bump; say so in the pull request.

## The conformance gate

```bash
node scripts/openapi-conformance.js
```

This checks the package against the API contract and against itself. It fails
by default when no contract is vendored, on purpose: a conformance step that
goes green having compared nothing manufactures exactly the assurance it
exists to provide. Point `NUMRA_OPENAPI` at a copy of the spec, or drop it at
one of the paths the script lists, to make it run for real.

## House style

British spelling, no emoji in headings, and prose that says what a thing does
rather than how good it is. Comments explain the decision, not the syntax.

## Reporting a bug

Open an issue with the package version, the Vue version, and the smallest
reproduction you can manage. **A security vulnerability is not a bug report**
— see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and mail it privately instead.
